    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      I have a problem with my minimap awereness. <br />
      At first I tried a simple solution. I took a sound and played it in loop
      every 5 seconds, every time I heard the sound I looked at the minimap. But
      after first 5 minutes I started to ignore the sound. <br />
      So I wrote a python script that took a folder of sounds and played them in
      customizable interval. That worked fine but I had a problem of finding
      good amount of short enough sounds. Also every sound was not equally loud.
      In the end I ended up with 5 or 6 sounds and it just took a little bit
      longer to start ignoring them too.
      <br />
      And it was a python script so if I wanted to share it, people would need
      to download potentionaly malicious code. <br />
      So I decided to make a web version of it. And I didn't want to code file
      handling operations to feed the page with sounds or provide only limited
      sounds I selected. <br />
      I needed to generate random sounds.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Plays sound every &#123;interval&#125; milliseconds for
      &#123;duration&#125; milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound is generated using oscillator
      <br />
      You can select between 2 types: <br />
      Sine is more natural sounding <br />
      Sawtooth is more of a buzzing sound

    <h2>How I use it</h2>
    <p>
      General advice is to look at minimap every 5 seconds. <br />
      That may be good if you are well trained but I tried to play the sound
      every 5 seconds and it was too annoying. <br />
      I set my interval at around 8 seconds. Also I use it more of a reminder
      and not a command. Should look, not a must look. <br />I try to look at
      minimap everytime there is a chance. When there is nothing to last-hit or
      after just last-hitting. When someone pings. When I am safe. And every
      time I hear the sound it reminds me to do just that. Not to look at the
      minimap immediately. If I have a second I'll look.

    <h2>Be careful with the volume</h2>
    <p>The volume is usually loud enough even when low.</p>

    <h2>Fun stuff</h2>
    <p>
      Try setting interval to 100 ms and enjoy your own little robot. Also lower
      the volume before trying this just to be safe!
